Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers globally, and early detection plays a crucial role in saving lives. This project leverages a Neural Network-based machine learning model to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). By using medical data, such as tumor features, the model provides accurate and reliable predictions to aid in early diagnosis.
